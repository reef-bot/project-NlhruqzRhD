# Discord Bot Project

## Project Description:

- Develop a moderation Discord bot that can help manage a Discord server by enforcing rules, moderating chat, and providing automated responses.
- The bot will have features such as kick, ban, mute, warn, and message logging.
- It will also have the ability to scan messages for inappropriate content and automatically delete or flag them.
- The bot will have a customizable prefix and commands that can be easily configured by server administrators.

## Improvements:

- Implement a user-friendly interface for administrators to easily configure bot settings.
- Add a feature that allows server members to report inappropriate behavior directly to the bot.
- Integrate machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of content scanning and moderation.
- Provide regular updates and maintenance to ensure the bot remains effective and up-to-date with Discord's features.
